## Authentication and Authorization

Authentication and authorization libraries are often shared across projects to ensure consistent and secure user management. These libraries typically include:

- **User authentication**: Handling login processes, password management, and session control
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Implementing protocols like SAML or OAuth for seamless access across multiple applications
- **Access control**: Managing user permissions and roles

## Logging and Monitoring

Shared logging libraries are crucial for maintaining consistent log formats and centralized log management across different services. Common features include:

- **Log formatting**: Standardizing log structures for easier analysis
- **Log aggregation**: Collecting and consolidating logs from multiple sources
- **Secrets redaction**: Automatically hiding sensitive information in logs

## Error Handling and Exceptions

A shared error handling library can provide a uniform approach to managing and reporting errors across different applications.

## Communication

Libraries for handling inter-service communication are often shared, including:

- **API clients**: Standardized ways to interact with internal or external APIs
- **Message queues**: Implementations for asynchronous communication between services

## Security

Shared security libraries can include:

- **Encryption/decryption**: Standardized methods for securing data
- **Input validation**: Common routines for sanitizing user inputs

## Configuration Management

A shared configuration library can provide a consistent way to manage application settings across different environments.

## Database Access

Shared database access libraries can provide standardized ways to interact with databases, including connection pooling and query building.

## Testing

Common testing utilities and frameworks are often shared to ensure consistent testing practices across projects.

## Utility Functions

General-purpose utility functions for common tasks like date/time manipulation, string processing, or data validation are frequently shared.

## Metrics and Telemetry

Libraries for collecting and reporting application metrics and performance data are often shared to ensure consistent monitoring across services.
