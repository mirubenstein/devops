<workflow_diagram>
The comprehensive DevOps workflow can be visualized as a linear progression of interconnected stages with feedback loops for continuous improvement.

1. **Planning and Requirements** ➔
2. **Source Code Management** ➔
3. **Continuous Integration (CI)** ➔
4. **Continuous Deployment (CD)** ➔
5. **Configuration Management** ➔
6. **Containerization and Orchestration** ➔
7. **Continuous Monitoring and Logging** ➔
8. **Security and Compliance** ➔
9. **Deployment Strategies** ➔
10. **Incident Management**

**Logic Gates for Failure and Retry:**

- After **CI**, if automated tests fail, the workflow loops back to **Source Code Management** for code fixes.
- Post **CD**, if deployment fails, the process triggers **Incident Management** and may perform a rollback via **Deployment Strategies**.
- Continuous monitoring feeds insights back into **Planning and Requirements** and **Configuration Management** for iterative improvements.

This cyclical flow ensures that the workflow is not strictly linear but allows for iterative feedback and continuous enhancement.
