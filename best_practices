Best Practices for CI/CD

    Establish Clear Metrics and KPIs: Define and track key performance indicators such as build time, deployment frequency, and mean time to recovery3
    .
    Automate Monitoring Processes: Implement automated monitoring tools to ensure early detection of issues and maintain system reliability3
    .
    Implement Robust Automated Testing: Ensure comprehensive test coverage to catch bugs early and maintain code quality1
    .
    Use Smaller, More Frequent Updates: This approach reduces the risk of large, buggy releases and allows for quicker response to feedback4
    .
    Secure the Production Environment: Limit access to production environments and use Infrastructure as Code for maintenance6
    .
    Create Separate Accounts for Each Environment: This practice simplifies deployment and allows for fine-grained access controls6
    .
    Implement Code Reviews: Require multiple code reviews before merging feature branches to maintain code quality and catch potential issues early6
    .
    Make Small and Frequent Merges: Push local changes into the pipeline continuously to keep development environments in sync6
