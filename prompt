The above requirements are not exhastive. Reach beyond to fill in any gaps as needed and call them out.
"Now, follow these steps to create your detailed DevOps workflow:
Make sure they are in order of operation and make a diagram in order of operation with logic gates for failure and retry"

1. Create a high-level structure of the DevOps workflow, breaking it down into logical stages. Each stage should be represented as a separate section in your response.

2. For each stage in the workflow:
a. Provide a brief description of the stage's purpose and importance in the overall DevOps process.
b. List and explain all possible steps within that stage.

3. After detailing all stages, create a comprehensive diagram that visually represents the entire DevOps workflow. Describe the diagram in text format, explaining how each stage connects to others and how the overall process flows.

4. Conclude with a summary of best practices for implementing and maintaining this DevOps workflow, highlighting key considerations for each stage.

Throughout your response, maintain a professional tone and use industry-standard terminology. Your explanation should be thorough and demonstrate deep knowledge of DevOps practices, tools, and methodologies.

Present your response in the following format:

<devops_workflow>
<introduction>
[Write a brief introduction to the DevOps workflow]
</introduction>

<stages>
[Detail each stage as described above]
</stages>

<workflow_diagram>
[Describe the comprehensive workflow diagram]
</workflow_diagram>

<best_practices>
[Summarize best practices and key considerations]
</best_practices>
</devops_workflow>

Remember to be exhaustive in your approach, covering all possible aspects of the DevOps workflow while maintaining the perspective of a professional developer specializing in DevOps.
